* In this project we aim to develop **AI-based disease screening mobile applications** for people in LDCs.
* We target **top ten diseases in LDCs**, and develop AI applications for top five most widely used phones in LDCs.
* As an initial step, we have developed an AI application for **Monkeypox Diagnosis**
